# ForestWanderer V1.0
Inspiration - The inspiration we had building this project was creating our game and being proud of the outcome
What it does - The game includes the physics to walk around in any direction, lock the cursor to move around with your mouse, sprinting while pressing left shift, crouch by pressing left control, and walking by just moving forward with the key "W". We also added movement sounds for running, crouching, and walking as well as added various kinds of weapons to switch out to.
How we built it - We build this game using 3D Unity and C#.
Challenges we ran into - The challenges we ran into were some bugs and time.
Accomplishments that we're proud of - We are very proud of what we accomplished during our first Hackathon, including the physics to move around, the ability to run, crouch, and walk, to hear footstep sounds, and cleaning up bugs.
What we learned - We learned a lot of C# and also a lot about development in Unity.
What's next for ForestWanderer - We hope to add on to ForestWanderer and make it a full game, with the amount of time we had we could not implement more things but we are sure to work on it in the future!
